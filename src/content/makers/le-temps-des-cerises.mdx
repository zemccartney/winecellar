An interesting anecdote about the maker, Axel Prufer:

  Because the forests are the natural habitat of wild boars, Prufer collects
  human hair from the hairdressers in the local village and spreads it around
  the boundary of his vineyard. He says that the boar pick up the human scent
  from the hair and avoid the vineyard. The vineyard is a picture of health with
  spiderwebs everywhere and an amazing biodiversity on display.
