Ploughed from the earth, as the folks at Maine and Loire said. It wasn't
viscous, of course, but it felt heavier, fuller in the mouth than most other
wines. On first sip, it almost didn't taste like anything for a split second,
just a deepness, for lack of a better word. Very enjoyable. Mild, but in an
interesting way. Felted suited for late on a quiet winter night.
