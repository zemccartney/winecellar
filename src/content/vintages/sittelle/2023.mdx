Smells of cooked rhubarb, but with an earth undertone, petrichor and vinegary
sweetness, spray of orange or grapefruit peel. The taste, undercurrent of this
mellow, jammy sweetness, backdrop to a freshness, like cool water, perfectly
balanced sourness. Think a perfect cherry pie, syrupy, but not cloying, just
tart enough. And then hidden, sometimes peeking out, subtle: bready, yeasty
note, like a bread-and-cheese bite buried under the rest.
