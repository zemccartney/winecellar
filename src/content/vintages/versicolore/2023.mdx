Made me think of a campfire, after rainfall earlier in the day. Subtle taste of
crusty bread, slightly burnt marshmallow, pleasant bitterness. Tastes like the
edge of spring, cool, damp, but still reaching for warming. Borderlines. Too
light for winter, but residual spiciness of that season, especially in its
smell. Candied orange peel, that undercurrent of bitter pith with spiced
sweetness layered on top.
