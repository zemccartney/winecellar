Exceptional. Wholly different from really every wine I've ever tried. Like a
soda masquerading as a wine. I don't have the biggest sweet tooth, — though I do
love a vanilla Coke from time to time — even less so for wines than say coffee
or food or other drinks, usually. But it was like the best of both, mellowing
each other out into this bizarre, but utterly delicious concoction.

Right off the bat, the color: borderline rootbeer-y. I had to hold my glass at
an angle under a light to see any sort of red tint. Smelled like like chilled
grape juice, like hay, sweet grass, citrus peel, alive, tingling.

Drinking, like a mellowed out ginger ale, not dry, not acidic at all, with the
bubbles pleasantly tingly still but not loudly carbonated. Vague fig-netwony
taste sits across the tongue if you let it sit in your mouth and foam and expand
before swallowing. I thought of, as a kid, my dad taking us on a walk through
the woods and showing us a sassafras plant, showing us how to scratch the bark
and how it smelled like root beer. This not-quite-sweet, not-quite-spiced,
not-quite-anything cola-y wine. So good.
