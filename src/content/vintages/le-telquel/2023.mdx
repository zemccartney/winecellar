Mild smell, pine almost? Very slightly funky hint, like hay, barnyardy, a horse
paddock in midsummer, smells of animal, not unpleasantly, but lively; cool,
fresh breeze.

But then the taste, peppery. Like pink peppercorn, rather; tingly, but still
fruity. So good. Thinking of sour melon, cranberry, very mildly, pleasantly
acidic. Notably tannic.

Pinchingly tart, but then fades quickly. Pinch on the mouth as you sip, then on
the sinuses as you swallow, from the alcohol, in between mellowness, blankets
the mouth as you chew it.

Dry, light, but not insubstantial, pleasant sweetness on the backend as you
swallow, too. But leaves the front of the mouth all dried out. Like a fruit tea,
almost. Like a hint of lemon or lime curd, perfectly balanced, lingering in a
piece of cake, a jammy tea biscuit, shortbread, not overpoweringly sweet. More a
vegetal sweetness, like a cooled roasted beet.
