Puckering. So acidic, sour, but really, really enjoyable. Very light. Zaps your
tongue so hard that it feels big and bold, but then lightens, dissipating faster
than it came. Almost tricks you into thinking it's effervescent. Still a
distinctly fruity taste behind the initial hit of sour, syrupy almost, but
hollowed out, enough of a hint that you'd say it's sweet, without tasting so.
Not tannic at all. Reminded me of, entirely as a compliment, a sour blue
raspberry jolly rancher. Which isn't a thing, but I mean like a blue raspberry
jolly rancher soaked in lemon juice. Seems perfect for the middle of summer,
alongside a tall glass (or by my preference, a large mason jar) of ice water.

[This seller](https://primalwine.com/products/le-temps-des-cerises-avanti-popolo)
described it as a vin de soif, which taught me the phrase vin de soif, or
drinking wine. Though more usefully, this definition:

  To say that it's a wine that quenches thirst like water is not enough. "It's a
  bottle that can be opened with one other person and that you're sure to finish
  within the evening!" For Morgan Hubert, wine purchasing manager at E.Leclerc,
  a major French retailer, the definition is obvious.
