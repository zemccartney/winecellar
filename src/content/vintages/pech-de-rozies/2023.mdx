Not remarkable, but very pleasant, all the same.

Gentle smell, waft of wood and new office furniture, like walking around a
Staples, ending with a floral note, faded white rose. Fresh apple, apple juice,
vaguely of orange and grapefruit peel. And the taste comparable, so light, bland
almost, no idea what to make of it. Flat, no acidity, only bite from the
alcohol, tingling. Bitter and minerally, like from Topo Chico or tonic water.
Sweetness and bitterness, swirling, layers of the same apple smell throughout.
