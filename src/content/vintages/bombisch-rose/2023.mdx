Smelled ... earthy, almost? Vaguely of wet dirt, a light smell, fleeting, but
with a masked, deep-fruit aroma... apple? banana, melon, vaguely? Sour apple,
like a green apple's skin? slightly vegetal? Rose, maybe? I couldn't really pin
down. And a beautiful, ruddy orange color.

Dry, no sweetness at all, but not particularly bitter. So mellow, tasteless
almost, but alcoholic, burning on the tongue and nose, but also this ambient
cooling in the middle of the taste.

Tannic, across the middle of the tongue. Oakish, woody, on breathing in after
tasting. Funky. Brett-y, almost. Seemed like there was this deceptive sweetness
to it, like a just-not-quite-ripe strawberry, the cusp of the white base beneath
the leaves, grading into red, tart, harder, but with a hint of the juice from
the main fruit, just enough to sand off the bitter, tannic edges.

I left feeling it wasn't my favorite, but when I think back to it, feel like
it's worth a retry. Seemed the perfect wine to serve with bread and butter on an
early summer day, heat climbing, not yet sweltering.
