A wine suited for unwinding on a Friday. So acidic, biting on the mouth and
tongue, but then by extreme contrast juicy and sweet on first taste. I tried
with a slew of nice pizzas from [Quanto Basta](https://quantobasta.me/), which
might just be the best pizza in Portland (the amatriciana and limone are
personal favorites): felt like both evaporated over the course of the evening.
So light and easy-drinking.
