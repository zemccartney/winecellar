Really good. Bright smell, pungently alcoholic. Taste, bright, sweetness like
fresh orange or frozen cherry. And mineral, rock smell almost, like a quarry in
hot sun (swimming hole when I was a kid, abandoned quarry, cobalt-colored lake
in the middle, we called Narnia, found through a hole in a busted old metal
fence). Very tannic; dries out the whole mouth, up through the front teeth.
Tried with pork loin, got only residual bitter taste, like all the sweetness and
acidity of the wine absorbed into the food; not unpleasant, but unexpected. In
retrospect, wouldn't want to pair it with anything, stands on its own. Reminded
me of damp wood, spring in Maine woods, cold humidity, for whatever reason.
