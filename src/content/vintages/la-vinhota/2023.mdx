Visually remarkable, smelled lovely. Ruby-tinted, smells of cranberry, sour,
pungent, with a mildly sweet undercurrent, like cherry pie, the sour of the
cherries and the sweetness of the syrup. Smelled fresh, too, reminiscent of
mossy rocks, floral, relaxing deepness of a running brook on a summer morning.

But disappointing. I loved the 2022; this was markedly different. Far sweeter
than I remember, syrupy, more body, lower tannin, lingering, gripping sweetness,
like watermelon candy. I wanted it to be tarter, drier, more complicated, like
the 2022, which, granted, one of the best wines I recall trying. It did mellow
out after decanting for a while, but still, not my taste.
