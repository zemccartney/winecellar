I really enjoyed this. Felt like a perfect fit for the season. Neither light and
vibrantly fruity, like something fit for midsummer, nor spiced and full bodied
like something for deep winter.Right in between. Tart, honey-esque, almost,
sweet, but not saccharine, mellowed out ghost of a mead. Perfect for the
occasion. Served cold, but not chilled, as cold as your tap water.
