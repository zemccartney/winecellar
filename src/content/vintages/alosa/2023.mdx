An interesting one. Smelled of tart blackberry, plum. The taste, sour, slightly
acidic, not really sweet at all, tannic. But then, an aftertaste of cured olive,
unctuous, briny, but still pleasant, not at all overpowering.

But really excellent paired with halibut, couscous with preserved lemon and feta
and caramelized red onion, and fris√©e with pickled red onion. The wine tied it
all together; juicy in contrast against the food, cleansing, olive aftertaste
totally gone, mellowed into the food.

A utilitarian wine. Not spectacular in its own right, but the perfect wine for a
meal, for conversation, for drinking on the side of something, complementing and
highlighting, but not a star in its own right.
